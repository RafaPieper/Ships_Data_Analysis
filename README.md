# Exploring the size of ships

Ships are large, complex vessels designed to travel across water, carrying people, goods, or performing specialized tasks like fishing, research, or military operations. They come in various shapes and sizes, each tailored to specific purposes.

Ships can be categorized based on their primary function. For example:

- Cargo Ships: Transport goods like containers, oil, or bulk materials.

- Passenger Ships: Carry people, such as cruise ships or ferries.

- Fishing Vessels: Designed for catching fish or other seafood.

- Specialized Ships: Include research vessels, tugboats, or military ships.

Each category has subcategories that further define their purpose. For instance, cargo ships can be divided into container ships, tankers, or bulk carriers.

To describe a ship’s size and capacity, we use specific measurements:

- Length: This is the distance from the front (bow) to the back (stern) of the ship. Longer ships generally have more space for cargo or passengers.

- Beam: The width of the ship at its widest point. A wider beam often means greater stability but may limit the ship’s ability to navigate narrow waterways.

- Gross Tonnage (GT): A measure of the ship’s total internal volume. It’s - not about weight but rather the space inside the ship. Higher GT usually indicates a larger vessel with more capacity.

- Deadweight Tonnage (DWT): This represents the total weight a ship can carry, including cargo, fuel, supplies, and crew. It’s a key indicator of a ship’s carrying capacity.

Understanding these dimensions helps us compare ships, assess their capabilities, and determine their suitability for specific tasks. For example:

A large cargo ship with high DWT can transport more goods, making it ideal for international trade.

A smaller fishing vessel with a narrow beam might be better suited for coastal waters.

## Fun fact

From the EDA, we can observe **MSC TESSA appears to be the biggest big with the most cargo capacity in this dataset**
